- Target Time: 3h
- Goal: Get a basic api in place that creates a complex record with a many-to-one relation of users to a word. There should user-specific parameters for that word. What is the condition for that to work? This may need to take the form of a specific API that does a lot of sever side loading rather that trying to finagle the details on the client side though numerous API calls. Rationale is to save the network call effort.
- Test details:
  - Should be able to delete the user-specific parameters when deleting the entire user (but not the words).
